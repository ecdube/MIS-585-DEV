            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p> This cafe was started in 2017 by its namesake Maggie, who wanted to bring her love of baking and brewing to a business.
                She started out of her own kitchen, cooking and delivering on and off. Her drinks and desserts were well loved enough 
                to help her move to a small kitchen on Main St, where she's been ever since. What started as one woman in her kitchen 
                has grown into a thriving small business and community. Thank you to our customers for supporting us!
